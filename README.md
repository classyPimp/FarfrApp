# FarfrApp
### description
FarfrApp is used for contract approval by employees, basic tasking (assigning emplyees to tasks), contract storage and search. 

Some companies use the approval grid for contracts before they are signed and concluded. Regualary they use a dedaline system, the specific approval grid for contracts by their subject or category. Some do it on paper manually which makes it hard to controll. With this app such functionality can be automated.

## conrtacts
App allows you to easilly track the approval process by employees who where included by executor (employee that is responsible for contract initiation and communicating with contragent (other party)) of contract to approvers. 

Users get their specific notifications, all notifications are tracked (for example if you have strict rules on approval deadlines, you will see the date when user was notified, visited the contract, approved it, leaved opinion and etc.).

As well the app can allow you to manage and store your contracts via uploading files, and track information such as was contract signed, was it send to other party, was it recieved, was the signed contract scan uploaded , where it is stored physically. Files can be marked (e.g. if the file is a final version)

It also has serach features that uses various serach filters. The search can be restricted to show only the contracts that users are allowed to.

Users can communicate through comment system under each contract, and leave their opinions or objections on contract draft.

Users do have a cabinet (their account) where all the neccessary information goes. They recieve info through notifications, it shows which notifications are new, have they visited the contract or event page already, notification are categorized, and they easilly can access needed information through link provided in notification.

They will see to what contracts they were included as approvers, objections made to drafts, replies made to objections, was objection satisfied, when and who has approved the contract, were new drafts uploaded.

They will be notified when the contract was signed, when it was sent to other party, when it was recived and at which emplyee it is stored.

For some actions the confirmation process exists where one user requests for another and another users needs to confirm it.

The users depending on their roles can make different specific actions. E.g. only the excutor can provide the tracking info. Non included users can not do anything related to cantract nor see it.

All files are protected and can't be download if user does not possess cpecific rigths.

The users can print/download the approval list as PDF including the objection made, to physically confirm the process. 

## tasks
users can assign each other to tasks ('assignments') with all neccessary information required. They can upload and share files and communicate through comment system. they can put deadlines. the assignment system has the ability to confirm whether the task was done, and assigned users can file their reports.

All the neccesary information goes to users 'cabinet' as well, which gives controll over process.
